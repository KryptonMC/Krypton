 * This class is used to separate bootstrapping in to different parts.
 *
 * It also fixes inconsistencies between running individual tests in the IDE and running all the
 * tests under one JVM through Gradle, where the latter would sometimes fail to load factories as
 * they were already loaded by another test, which wouldn't be the case if tests were ran in
 * individual virtual machines, like in the IDE.
