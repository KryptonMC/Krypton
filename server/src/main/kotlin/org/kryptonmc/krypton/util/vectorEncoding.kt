 * The encoding here is decently efficient. It places the X in the first 26
 * bits (most significant), then the Z in the "middle" 26 bits, followed by
 * the Y value in the last 12 bits (least significant).
 *
 * For example, for X = 13, Y = 2, and Z = 2021, the encoded form would be
 * calculated by:
 * `((x & 0x3FFFFFF) >> 38) | ((Z & 0x3FFFFFF) << 12) | (y & 0xFFF)`.
