/**
 * Calculates a chunk position from a given [id] in a spiral pattern.
 *
 * This algorithm was previously part of Krypton (https://github.com/KryptonMC/Krypton), however it was removed after
 * it was no longer used.
 *
 * **Algorithm:**
 *
 * Given n, an index in the squared spiral
 * p, the sum of a point in the inner square
 * and a, the position on the current square
 *
 * n = p + a
 *
 * Credit for this algorithm goes to
 * [davidonet](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1068670/davidonet) (for the original algorithm),
 * and [Esophose](https://github.com/Esophose) (for the Kotlin conversion and modifications)
 *
 * See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/398299/looping-in-a-spiral) for original
 *
 * @param id the id in the spiral
 * @param xOffset an optional X offset
 * @param zOffset an optional Z offset
 * @return a [ChunkPosition] containing the calculated position in the spiral.
