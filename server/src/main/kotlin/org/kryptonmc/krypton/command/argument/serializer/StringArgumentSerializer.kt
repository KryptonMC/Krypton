 * String argument types only serialize the type of string argument they are.

 * * SINGLE_WORD - reads until it finds a space
 * * QUOTABLE_PHRASE - if the string starts with ", keeps reading until another
 *   " appears closing it off (can escape with \), otherwise behaves the same
 *   as SINGLE_WORD
 * * GREEDY_STRING - reads until there is nothing more to be read
