The method to use for forwarding a connecting user's information on
to Krypton from a proxy server. Supported values are:
  - NONE - Disable forwarding support completely
  - LEGACY - Use the BungeeCord/pre-1.13 method
  - MODERN - Use Velocity's modern forwarding protocol
  - TCPSHIELD - Use TCPShield's forwarding protocol
When any mode other than NONE or TCPSHIELD is used, the server will be forced
offline and will ONLY accept connections from proxies. No users will be able to
