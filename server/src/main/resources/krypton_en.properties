  SERVER IS IN OFFLINE MODE! THIS SERVER WILL MAKE NO ATTEMPTS TO AUTHENTICATE USERS!\n\

krypton.metrics.info=\
  Krypton and some of its plugins collect metrics and send them to bStats (https://bstats.org).\n\
  bStats collects some basic information for plugin authors, like how many people use\n\
  their plugin and their total player count. It''s recommended to keep bStats enabled, but\n\
  if you''re not comfortable with this, you can opt-out by editing the config.txt file in\n\
  the ''/plugins/bStats/'' folder and setting enabled to false.

krypton.watchdog.dump.stack.element=\t\t{0}
krypton.watchdog.stopped=\
  The server has stopped responding! This could be, but is not likely to be, an issue with Krypton.\n\
  If you see a plugin in the server thread dump below, then please report it to that author.\n\
  \t *Especially* if it looks like HTTP or MySQL operations are occurring\n\
  If you see a world save or edit, then it likely means you tried to do much more than your server can handle at once\n\
  \t If this is the case, consider increasing timeout-time in the main configuration file. Please note, however, that this will replace this crash with LARGE lag spikes\n\
  If you are still unsure, or you think that this actually a Krypton issue, especially if you see org.kryptonmc at the top of the trace, please report this to https://github.com/KryptonMC/Krypton/issues\n\
  When reporting to Krypton, please ensure that you include all relevant console errors and thread dumps, as this will help us diagnose your issue easier.\n\
