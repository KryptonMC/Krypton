# Krypton

Krypton is a Minecraft server implementation, written purely from scratch in Kotlin.

It is currently a W.I.P, so if you find any bugs, feel free to make an issue about them

### Usage

We now have a Jenkins CI server! You can find it at https://ci.kryptonmc.org

You can download the latest JAR file from here and run it with `java -jar Krypton-VERSION.jar`. If you have any
questions, feel free to ask in our Discord server.

Or, if you prefer, you can clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/KryptonMC/Krypton.git`
and build from source with `gradle shadowJar` if you wish to run the server.

**WARNING: Krypton is far from production ready. DO NOT USE ON PRODUCTION SERVERS! WILL CONTAIN BUGS! You have been
warned.**

### API

As of version 0.11, Krypton now has an API. It is heavily in development, so expect to find bugs, but it is at least
semi-functional.

You can depend on it like this:

* Gradle Kotlin DSL:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven("https://libraries.minecraft.net")
    maven("https://repo.kryptonmc.org/releases")
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("org.kryptonmc:api:LATEST")
}
```

* Gradle Groovy DSL:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://libraries.minecraft.net' } // for Brigadier
    maven { url 'https://repo.kryptonmc.org/releases' }
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly 'org.kryptonmc:api:LATEST'
}
```

* Maven:

```xml
<repositories>
    <!-- For Brigadier -->
    <repository>
        <id>minecraft</id>
        <url>https://libraries.minecraft.net</url>
    </repository>
    <repository>
        <id>kryptonmc</id>
        <url>https://repo.kryptonmc.org/releases</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.kryptonmc</groupId>
        <artifactId>api</artifactId>
        <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

The documentation for both the API and the server can now be found [here](https://docs.kryptonmc.org), and the
wiki on how to use the API can be found [here](https://wiki.kryptonmc.org)

Example usage:

```kotlin
// As of 0.22.1, we now use Guice, meaning you can now inject your required dependencies
// in any one of your classes throughout the project
class MyPlugin @Inject constructor(commandManager: CommandManager, command: MyCommand) {

    init {
        commandManager.register(command) // example command registration
    }

    @Listener
    fun initialize() {
        // This is called after things like your plugin's container have finished initialising,
        // so it is safe to use them here.
    }
}
```

If you have any questions about the usage of the API, feel free to join our Discord server!

Or if you have an idea on how I could improve the API, feel free to open an issue.

wouldn't be possible without contributions.
