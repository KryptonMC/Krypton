 * characters, dashes, and underscores, and it must be between 1 and 64 characters in
 * length
 * @param name the human readable name of this plugin, as to be used in descriptions and
 * similar tags. This does not have to be unique, but is recommended to be, to
 * avoid confusion for users with other plugins with the same name
 * @param version the version of this plugin, or empty for undefined
 * @param description the description of this plugin, explaining what it can be used for
 * @param authors a list of people who helped create this plugin
