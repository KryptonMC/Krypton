/**
 * Marker annotation indicating that the annotated type is a catalogue type,
 * usually meaning it provides access to many static instances of the given
 * catalogued [type].
 *
 * All types contained within this API that are annotated with this
 * annotation will meet certain requirements that are listed below, and it is
 * also highly recommended that users of this annotation also meet the same
 * requirements, as follows:
 * - The values made available within this type must remain constant for
 * the entire runtime.
 * - All values must not be references to null, or any other types that could
 * cause ambiguity or annoyance for users of the API.
 *
 * In addition, it is possible for two constant values to point to the same
 * object, for the purpose of creating aliases.
 *
 * Furthermore, not all catalogue types are exhaustive, there may be more
 * instances of the catalogued type available. Within the scope of this API,
 * all of the constants listed in the catalogue type will always be an
 * exhaustive list of all of the known constants that are guaranteed to always
 * be available.
