/**
 * This abstract class defines common defaults between both of its expected
 * implementations, [Vector] and [Location].
 *
 * To keep consistency, a [Position] will always be destructured into (x, y, z),
 * regardless if the implementation has any other fields (such as [Location] having
 * yaw and pitch).
 *
 * The copy function will also only work on the X, Y and Z coordinates of the location.
 * The implementation may also have its own copy function however that can operate on
 * more than just these three.
 *
 * In addition, this class is also responsible for specialising all of the return types
 * of the functions inherited from [Position], so that assignment works as it should.
