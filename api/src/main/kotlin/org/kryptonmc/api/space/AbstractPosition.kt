 * This abstract class defines common defaults between both of its expected implementations,
 * [Vector] and [org.kryptonmc.api.world.Location].
 *
 * To keep consistency, a [Position] will always be destructured into (x, y, z), regardless
 * if the implementation has any other fields (such as [org.kryptonmc.api.world.Location] having
 * world, yaw and pitch).
 *
 * The copy function will also only world on the X, Y and Z coordinates of the location. The
 * implementation may also have its own copy function however that can operate on more than
 * just these three.
