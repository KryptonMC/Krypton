 * A block entity is an entity that exists as a companion to a block, so that

 * Despite the name, however, these do not behave anything like regular
 * entities. They do not actually exist to the end user, cannot be seen, and
 * only exist to hold data that blocks cannot.
 *
 * These used to be known as tile entities, for all of you folks who remember
 * those days.
