 * Indicates the shape of a minecart rail this property is applied to

 * Minecart rails can be in one of three layouts:
 * * Straight flat, which will keep the Minecart on the same Y level and
 *   direction of travel. These rails can either be north to south or east to
 *   west.
 * * Straight ascending, which will ascend the Minecart up by one Y level, and
 *   maintain the same direction of travel.
 * * Corner, which will change the Minecart's orientation by 90 degrees,
 *   either clockwise or anticlockwise, depending on the direction change.
