 * is called on a node, the node will first check if it has any listeners for
 * the event, calling those first, then the event will propagate down the tree
 * to all children of the node, in order of their priority.
 *
 * If an event in the tree is cancelled, it will not propagate to any other
 * nodes, and its dispatching will be considered complete. No further event
 * listeners will receive the event.
 *
 * Every event node has a name, which should be uniquely identifiable, and
 * will be useful for debugging, as well as identifying the node in the tree.
